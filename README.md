- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @wmalott23. I am a new software developer currently looking for employment. Feel free to look around about my previous projects! If you are an employer looking at my github profile in order to discern whether or not I am employable, I highly recommend looking at my Capstone project first, which was accomplished during a 10 day coding sprint. Another great option is the YouTube clone which uses the Google API along side a local API for comments on videos and a user-authentication system. I hope you have a lovely day!
